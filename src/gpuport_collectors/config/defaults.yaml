# GPUPort Collectors Default Configuration
#
# This file defines default settings for timeouts, retries, and other global configuration
# values used across all provider collectors.

# HTTP Request Settings
# Default timeout for HTTP requests in seconds
timeout: 30

# Retry Settings
# Maximum number of retry attempts for failed requests
max_retries: 3

# Exponential backoff factor for retry delays
# Delay between retries = base_delay * (backoff_factor ^ retry_number)
# Example: with base_delay=5 and backoff_factor=2, delays will be 5s, 10s, 20s
backoff_factor: 2.0

# Initial delay for retry backoff in seconds
base_delay: 5.0

# Observability Settings
observability:
  # Enable/disable observability (logging and tracing)
  enabled: false

  # Honeycomb API key (can also be set via HONEYCOMB_API_KEY environment variable)
  honeycomb_api_key: null

  # Service name for telemetry
  service_name: "gpuport-collectors"

  # Environment name (production, staging, development, etc.)
  environment: "development"

  # Logging level (DEBUG, INFO, WARNING, ERROR, CRITICAL)
  log_level: "INFO"

  # OTLP exporter protocol (http/protobuf or grpc)
  exporter_protocol: "http/protobuf"

  # OTLP exporter endpoint
  exporter_endpoint: "https://api.honeycomb.io:443"

# Collector-Specific Settings
collectors:
  # RunPod collector configuration
  runpod:
    enabled: true
    # API key (use RUNPOD_API_KEY environment variable)
    api_key: null
